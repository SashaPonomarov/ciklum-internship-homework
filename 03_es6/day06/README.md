# Ciklum JS Internship homework

## Task 03, Advent of Code day 6 task, using ES6 syntax

Link to the task: http://adventofcode.com/day/6

The task consists of two parts, 'part1.js' and 'part2.js'. To see the results, execute these files in node.

Both parts find how many lights in 1000x1000 grid will be lit after following the set of instructions. The difference between part1 and part2 is in a way the instructions are interpreted.

Also I added visualization of lit grid using canvas. To view it, open 'draw/index.html' file in browser.
