# Ciklum JS Internship homework

## Task 05, omdb API search using Angular

To run the app:
- clone repository and cd into it
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start` to laucnh webpack dev server at localhost:8080

or
- run `npm run build` to build the app into `build` folder
- open `build/index.html` in your browser


NOTE: This solution is very basic. I have refactored and enhanced it in the next task here: [Task 06](https://github.com/SashaPonomarov/ciklum-internship-homework/tree/master/06_omdb_angular_routes)
